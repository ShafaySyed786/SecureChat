# SecureChat

Basically, this is a rough online group chat that you can run. I used an AWS EC2 instance that runs
the server.py file and then anyone can run client.py to connect to the server. The server.py program
will then relay all messages to all other clients connected to the server.

# How to use on your own

Set up your own AWS EC2 instance and in the server code, change the IP to the IP of your AWS EC2 Instance.
For the client code, do the same thing.
